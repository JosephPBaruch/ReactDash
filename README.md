# ReactDash

Learning as much as I can about react in one weekend.

## Programming Log

- 10/7: Working on initializing everything and learning the basics in a tutorial. Tomorrow I will work on personalizing it and making it my own. I need to take the approach of making my own and learning through my own problems rather than watching a tutorial.
